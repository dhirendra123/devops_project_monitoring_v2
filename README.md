# DevOps Project Monitoring v2

This project is a **real-world simulation of log monitoring and backup automation** using shell scripting.  
It is designed for learning DevOps fundamentals without requiring any cloud access.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Log Generation**: Simulates application logs with different log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR).
- **Log Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of logs using `tail` and `grep` with color-coded output.
- **Log Rotation & Backup**: Archives old logs into a backup directory using `tar` and timestamping.
